# Clicky-Game
HW15 Clicky Game

## Overview
This is a memory game created with React. This application was made to practice utilizing the fundamentals of React by breaking up my application's UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events.



## Instructions
This memory game will render different images of characters from the show Bob's Burgers on to the screen.
Each image will listen for click events. The application will keep track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will reset to 0 if the user clicks the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.

## Play
- This memory game will have different images of the characters for the show Bob's Burgers.
- Click on images to raise your score.
- The images will change after every click.
- Do not click on the same image twice or you will lose.
- If you lose, your score will be reset back to zero!
